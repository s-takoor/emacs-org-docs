* 🚀 TL;DR
If you're facing issues with your sudo configuration and need a quick fix, follow these steps to restore your ~~/etc/pam.d/sudo~ file.

** 🔩 STEPS
- **Create a New sudo File:**
  Create a file named `sudo` with the following content:
         #+begin_src sh
# sudo: auth account password session
auth       optional       /opt/homebrew/lib/pam/pam_reattach.so
auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
auth       sufficient     pam_smartcard.so
auth       required       pam_opendirectory.so
account    required       pam_permit.so
password   required       pam_deny.so
session    required       pam_permit.so
         #+end_src

- **Replace the Misconfigured sudo File:**
  Use Finder or the terminal to move the newly created `sudo` file to ~~/etc/pam.d/~, replacing the misconfigured one.

  + **Using Finder:**
    Open Finder and navigate to `/etc/pam.d/`. Replace the existing `sudo` file with the newly created one.

  + **Using Terminal:**
    Run the following command in the terminal:
    #+begin_src sh
open /etc/pam.d/
    #+end_src

** 🗓️ NOTE
- Ensure that the new `sudo` file has the correct permissions and ownership after moving it to ~~/etc/pam.d/~.
- This quick fix assumes that you have the necessary privileges to modify system files.

** 🗞️ CONCLUSION
Following these steps should help you quickly restore your sudo configuration, ensuring smooth authentication on your macOS system.

** TL;DR
This is a summary of the latest version of PCI DSS (currently v4.0). These controls should be considered as a minimum requirement to comply with the standard.

** MAINTAIN SECURE NETWORKS
- [X] Implement and configure firewalls, routers, switches, and other network devices according to best practices and PCI DSS standards
- [X] Implement strong access control measures for remote access to the network, such as multi-factor authentication and encryption
- [X] Use secure protocols like SSL/TLS or SSH for transmitting cardholder data over networks
- [X] Segment the network into subnets to limit access to sensitive areas
- [X] Regularly monitor network traffic for unusual activity

** PROTECT CARDHOLDER DATA
- [X] Implement strong cryptography methods for protecting cardholder data, such as AES-256 or RSA 4096-bit keys
- [X] Establish a clear data classification policy and implement appropriate access controls
- [X] Implement regular backups of cardholder data and ensure the backups are encrypted
- [X] Implement processes to securely dispose of media that contain cardholder data

** MAINTAIN A VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
- [X] Perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests
- [X] Apply security patches and software updates ina  timely manner
- [X] Implement a process for handling discovered vulnerabilities, such as CVEs (Common Vulnerbilities and Exposures)
- [X] Regularly review system configurations for compliance with PCI DSS requirements

** IMPLEMENT STRONG ACCESS CONTROL MEASURES
- [X] Implement role-based access control and least privilege principles
- [X] Use strong password policies, such as complexity requirements and regular password changes
- [X] Implement two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication for high-risk areas
- [X] Regularly review and update access controls and user privileges

** REGULARLY MONITOR AND TEST NETWORKS
- [X] Implement log monitoring systems to detect unauthorised access or unusual activity
- [X] Use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to identify and respond to threats
- [X] Conduct regular security awareness training for employees
- [X] Develop incident response plans and test them regularly

** MAINTAIN AN INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
- [X] Establish, document, communicate, and update the information security policy
- [X] Regularly review and test the information security program for effectiveness
- [X] Ensure that all employees receive necessary training and are aware of their roles and responsibilities in maintaining PCI DSS compliance
- [X] Implement a process to address non-compliance issues, such as disciplinary actions or additional training

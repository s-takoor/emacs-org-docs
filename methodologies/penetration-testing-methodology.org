** TL;DR

** RECONNAISSANCE
*** INFORMATION GATHERING
- [X] Perform OSINT using ltools like Maltego, Shodan, or Google Dorks
- [X] Analyse WHOIS records and DNS information
- [X] Identify subdomains and associated domains
- [X] Gather email address, phone numbers, and physical addresses
- [X] Review social media profiles and employee information
- [X] Map out the organisation's infrastructure

*** NETWORK MAPPING
- [X] Perform active scan using Nmap or Nessus
- [X] Discover open ports, services, and operating systems on target hosts
- [X] Enumerate hosts, devices, and services
- [X] Identify vulnerabilities based on CVE database or other sources
- [X] Document all discovered information

** VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
*** SCANNING
- [X] Perform passive and active reconnaissance using tools like Nmap, OpenVas, or Nessus
- [X] Identify vulnerabilities in operating systems, web applications, and network services

*** MANUAL TESTING
